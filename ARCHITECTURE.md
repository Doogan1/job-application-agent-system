## System Overview

The Job Application Agent System uses a modular agent-based architecture. Each agent specializes in a specific part of the job application process, with well-defined interfaces for communication between agents.

The system follows a pipeline pattern, where job opportunities flow through various processing stages:

1. **Discovery**: Finding and filtering job opportunities
2. **Preparation**: Creating tailored application materials
3. **Submission**: Applying to the job opportunities
4. **Follow-up**: Managing post-application communication

## Component Architecture

The system consists of four primary agent components:

### JobFinder
- **Responsibility**: Discovers and filters job opportunities.
- **Key Functions**: 
  - Search job boards (LinkedIn, Indeed, Glassdoor)
  - Filter based on user preferences
  - Store job listings in database

### ResumeTailor
- **Responsibility**: Creates customized resumes for specific job listings.
- **Key Functions**: 
  - Analyze job descriptions for key requirements
  - Match requirements to user skills and experience
  - Generate targeted resumes using templates

### LetterWriter
- **Responsibility**: Generates personalized cover letters.
- **Key Functions**: 
  - Research company information
  - Create targeted cover letters
  - Tailor content to job requirements

### ApplicationSubmitter
- **Responsibility**: Submits applications and manages follow-ups.
- **Key Functions**: 
  - Submit applications via appropriate channels
  - Track application status
  - Schedule and send follow-up communications

## Data Models

### JobListing

```python
@dataclass
class JobListing:
    """Data class for job listings"""
    id: str
    title: str
    company: str
    location: str
    description: str
    url: str
    date_posted: str
    salary_range: Optional[str] = None
    requirements: Optional[List[str]] = None
    benefits: Optional[List[str]] = None
    application_url: Optional[str] = None
    company_details: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None
```

### ApplicationResult

```python
@dataclass
class ApplicationResult:
    """Data class for application submission results"""
    success: bool
    job_id: str
    submission_date: str
    confirmation_id: Optional[str] = None
    error: Optional[str] = None
    notes: Optional[str] = None
```

## Component Interfaces

### 1. JobFinder → ResumeTailor
```python
# JobFinder produces JobListing objects
job_listings = job_finder.find_jobs()

# ResumeTailor consumes JobListing objects
resume = resume_tailor.create_resume(job_listing)
```

### 2. ResumeTailor → LetterWriter
```python
# ResumeTailor produces resume dictionary
resume = resume_tailor.create_resume(job_listing)

# LetterWriter consumes both JobListing and resume dictionary
cover_letter = letter_writer.create_letter(job_listing, resume)
```

### 3. LetterWriter → ApplicationSubmitter
```python
# ApplicationSubmitter consumes JobListing, resume, and cover_letter
result = application_submitter.submit(job_listing, resume, cover_letter)
```

## Utility Services

The system includes several utility services that provide common functionality to the agent components:

### Database (utils/database.py)
- Stores job listings, application records, and statistics
- Provides methods for CRUD operations on all data types
- Handles database backups

```python
# Database interface examples
database.save_job_listing(job)
jobs = database.get_job_listings(status="discovered")
application_id = database.save_application(application_data)
```

### API Client (utils/api_client.py)
- Provides unified access to external APIs
- Handles authentication and rate limiting
- Implements retry logic and error handling

```python
# API client interface examples
cover_letter_text = api_client.generate_text(prompt)
linkedin_jobs = api_client.search_linkedin_jobs(keywords, location)
result = api_client.submit_application(platform, job_id, resume_path, cover_letter_path, user_info)
```

### Document Processor (utils/document_processor.py)
- Creates and manipulates document files
- Supports multiple formats (DOCX, PDF)
- Handles template-based document generation

```python
# Document processor interface examples
DocumentProcessor.create_docx(resume_content, template_path, output_path)
DocumentProcessor.create_pdf(letter_content, template_path, output_path)
```

## Data Flow

1. **Job Discovery Flow**:
   ```
   Job Board APIs → JobFinder → Database
   ```

2. **Application Preparation Flow**:
   ```
   Database → JobFinder → ResumeTailor → LetterWriter → File System
   ```

3. **Application Submission Flow**:
   ```
   Database + File System → ApplicationSubmitter → Job Application APIs → Database
   ```

4. **Follow-up Flow**:
   ```
   Database → ApplicationSubmitter → Email/API → Database
   ```

## Design Decisions

### 1. Agent-Based Architecture
**Decision**: Use separate agent components for different stages of the job application process.

**Rationale**:
- Allows for independent development and testing of each component
- Enables easy replacement or extension of individual components
- Supports running components independently (e.g., just job discovery) if needed

### 2. Data Models as Interface Contracts
**Decision**: Use data classes to define clear interfaces between components.

**Rationale**:
- Provides explicit contracts for data exchange
- Makes dependencies clear and traceable
- Supports type hints for better IDE integration and error checking

### 3. Central Configuration
**Decision**: Use a central configuration object passed to all components.

**Rationale**:
- Single source of truth for system settings
- Easy to update configuration without changing code
- Supports different configurations for development, testing, and production

### 4. SQLite Database
**Decision**: Use SQLite for data storage.

**Rationale**:
- No need for a separate database server
- Simple setup and maintenance
- Sufficient performance for the expected data volume
- Easy to back up and restore

### 5. Document Template Approach
**Decision**: Use templates for document generation.

**Rationale**:
- Provides consistent formatting for all documents
- Separates content generation from document formatting
- Makes it easy to change document appearance

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Each component should be tested in isolation
- Mock dependencies for clean testing boundaries
- Focus on testing business logic rather than integration

### Integration Testing
- Test interactions between components
- Verify correct data flow through the system
- Use test fixtures for consistent test data

### End-to-End Testing
- Test complete job application flows
- Use mock APIs for external services
- Verify system behavior from user perspective

## Future Architecture Considerations

### 1. Event-Based Architecture
Future versions may implement an event-driven architecture:

```python
# Event-based interface examples
event_bus.publish("job.discovered", job_data)
event_bus.subscribe("job.discovered", resume_tailor.process_new_job)
```

Benefits:
- Better decoupling between components
- Easier to add new components without changing existing ones
- Support for asynchronous processing

### 2. Microservices Architecture
For larger scale deployments, consider splitting into microservices:
- JobFinderService
- ResumeTailorService
- LetterWriterService
- ApplicationService
- DatabaseService

Benefits:
- Independent scaling of components
- Better isolation and resilience
- Support for different technology stacks per service

### 3. Web UI Dashboard
Adding a web interface for monitoring and control:
- Application tracking dashboard
- Configuration management
- Resume and cover letter templates management
- Analytics and reporting

### 4. Enhanced AI Capabilities
Expand the use of AI throughout the system:
- Improved job matching algorithms
- More sophisticated resume tailoring
- Advanced company research and cover letter generation
- Interview simulation and preparation
